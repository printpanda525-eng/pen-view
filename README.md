# Pen View

Pen View is a lightweight Blender add-on designed to improve viewport navigation and workflow for pen tablet users, compact keyboards, and laptops without a numeric keypad.

The add-on provides quick access to common view, mode, and overlay tools through a customizable interface, allowing users to choose between a Pie Menu or a floating Popup UI.
